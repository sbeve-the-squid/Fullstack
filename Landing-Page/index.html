                        <p>Let me ask <i>you</i> a question. Would the question ever be asked of the opposite opinion (that birds are real)? No? Then I take high offense to your line of questioning.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <div class="bird-animation"></div>
                        <p>Simple. "Birds" charge by resting on powerlines, which is also how they download instructions and files from the Pentagon. </p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <label for="question3" class="faq-question">Why do birds fly in a V-formation?</label>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <div class="bird-animation"></div>
                        <p>The V-formation is an advanced <i>aerial Wi-Fi mesh network</i>. When they fly in a V, each bird is acting as a node in the network, bouncing signals off each other to expand their surveillance range. It’s also very energy-efficient for keeping their batteries charged while they monitor suspicious human activities—like hiking or having a picnic. </p>

                        <div class="bird-animation"></div>
                        <p>Big Bird? More like Big Brother. Haven't you ever wondered why they gave him such a prominent role on children's television? It’s brainwashing starting at a young age. </p>

                        <div class="bird-animation"></div>
                        <p>Avoid public parks, install bird-proof glass on your windows, and never feed ducks at the pond. Ducks are the <i>most elite</i> surveillance model out there, by the way. If you must interact with a bird, wear a hoodie and sunglasses to obscure your identity. </p>
